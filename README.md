# EDA
EDA on the SOKA logs
The assignment is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the datasets where data is analyzed to summarize the main characteristics of the datasets. Steps involved in an EDA are as follows:
  1) Look at the structure of the data
  2) Pose an initial question that the data could answer 
  3) Access the fitness of the data and check if it needs any cleaning. Clean the data if required.
  4) Visualise the data into different types of graphs like Bar Chart, Box Plot, Line Graphs, Scatter Plots, etc
  5) Find out the patterns and trends from these visualisations
  6) Arrive at useful insights and conclusions


## Step 1 Importing the packages
Packages like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn are imported

## Step 2 Reading the datasets
